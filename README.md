WHAT IS SHINY?
========================================================

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications (apps) straight from R PROGRAM.

Shiny apps have two components:

I-) User interface (UI.R) script, which controls the layout and appearance of the app.

II-) Server script (server.R), that will give the instructions that R programming needs to build the app.
